                            Criticism of movies: through the experts’ lenses
                        </h2>

                        <p>
                            Ilona Dragomir There’s no easy answer: as long as filmmakers have been making films, film
                            critics have criticised them!
                        </p>

                        <p>

                                A sweaty, confusing journey behind the scenes: finding the perfect movie
                            </b>
                        </p>

                        <p><i>“Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine.”-
                            Casablanca, 1942.</i></p>

                        <p>
                            It’s hard to admit how deeply emotional and sensitive we are. It almost hurts how much we
                            feel all the time. Of course, there’s hardly any reason to live a life without feeling the
                            world around you. So if you were to consider the overall production value of a human’s life,
                            you’d question the nature of their feelings. Was their life impactful, entertaining,
                            cohesive, suspenseful…was it felt? Was it warm? Was it worth it? These might seem strange
                            questions to ponder, but a human life- just like a movie- is constantly written, directed,
                            acted, and improvised. The individual, blessed or cursed with all this free will at hand,
                            has to make decisions all the time, and based on his desires, needs and feelings, and
                            perhaps circumstances, he must build a path to follow. His path is his story- the legacy
                            that he lives behind, with a signature in his own blood. That story belongs to him in the
                            most subjective manner, so other people’s opinions have no value- one fellow might
                            appreciate it as gold, but another as dust. This concept needs to be underlined- a man’s
                            life is pure art, pure feeling, pure creation, and any judgement is irrelevant:
                            <br><br><i>Of all the movies in all the movie cinemas in all the world, I watched my
                            own.</i>
                            <br><br>So what we experience- the complexity of this concept called life, with the chaos
                            and order of it - is what we know, what we are familiar with, what we understand and what we
                            feel. The seven types of arts that we have are simply and elegantly means that portray life
                            in some form or another. A film, as the most overwhelming, comprehensive, and inclusive type
                            of art- and mean of expression, is the only one that holds the power of telling not a story,
                            but a life. It is the only one that can truly consume our focus, absorb our senses, and make
                            us feel someone else’s life, a life different than ours, but in such a manner that it might
                            as well be ours for a little while.
                            <br><br>Therefore, he who stands behind the creative process will learn to know his god-like
                            forces. And maybe, when he has learnt them… he will think less and feel more- for that is
                            the only true way of creating.
                            <br><br>The perfect movie can not stand straight- it must bend like water, it must feel, it
                            must offer us both what we know and what we believe. And of course, there cannot be one
                            perfect movie, because there’s a different perfect movie for everyone. Why? Because we are
                            all very much alike while being all so different, and our perfect movies are all so
                            different, while being somehow very much alike: their receptivity to our lives, to our souls
                            is the common denominator, but perhaps nothing more than that.
                            <br><br>Creating some fellow’s perfect movie is, surely, not an easy task. The screenplay,
                            as the blueprint and foundation of a film, can only take you so far. Making a movie is so
                            much like making a baby: in the way that it’s almost a miracle. Making a perfect movie might
                            just be the most collaborative medium there is, requiring a harmonious blend of departments,
                            skills, jobs, talents of multiple technicians and artists, all fighting together to make one
                            cohesive product, all while trying to navigate the difficulty of mediating interactions
                            between creative wills.
                            <br><br>A perfect movie has a strong story structure, that manages to reinforce its themes
                            from beginning to end, giving it clarity and order, offering satisfaction to the viewer.
                            When done the right way, it looks easy and freeing, and the sum seems bigger than the
                            individual parts. It goes unnoticed, and then all at once, becomes overwhelmingly
                            impressive. This seamless story structure, this seamless narrative is the magic that makes
                            it feel real, easy, authentic.
                            <br><br>These are the tales that draw you into the movie world. They are immersive and
                            accessible regardless of how familiar the audience may be with the subject matter or
                            backstory. The real story that leaves the viewer wanting more when the credits roll.
                            <br><br>These films have the rare distinction of causing people to become an evangelist for
                            their cause. Every person you know must know about this film. Stories that serve as a
                            catalyst for a multitude of conversations afterwards and potentially a desire to go see it
                            again the next day. You want more and you cannot get enough.
                            <br><br>As your own film critic, these are the stories that become part of ‘your story.’ You
                            know they have impacted your life when you say critical portions of the script or key lines
                            afterwards. When you begin to see the demeanour of the characters reflected in your
                            day-to-day life. Or when the film's message permeates your world to the point of changing it
                            forever. These are the rare films that reach down into your soul, affect you profoundly and
                            come to define something about your identity. This may sound like an overstatement, but who
                            hasn’t said ‘You can’t handle the truth’ or ‘May the force be with you’ in a conversation
                            throughout the years? These are the stories that prove they are significant, because they
                            live on in you; by manifesting their influence and their liveliness, they certify the human
                            legacy that they represent.
                            <br><br>Ultimately, a good movie makes you feel; good comedies make you laugh, good dramas
                            make you cry, good thrillers make you tense, good horror makes you scared; and good action
                            adventures get you fired up. A perfect movie mirrors a life well lived, mirrors lessons and
                            mistakes, it makes you feel like you’ve spent your time well and it forces you to come out
                            feeling something strongly.
                            <br><br>Without feeling, a movie is just a string of moving pictures; with feeling, a movie
                            means much more – it matters. It has a weight on you, it leaves a trace.

                            Famous ‘film recipes’ along the decades

                        </h2>

                        <p>
                            Very easily influenced by the socio-economic aspect, film entertainment has made sure to
                            comply with the national and international background. So even if each film vision aspires
                            to be unique and daring, to provoke thought and incite emotion, ‘film recipes’ have long
                            been more successful than independent productions, which admits to the sad realization that
                            movie watchers aren’t always looking for perfect movies.
                            <br><br>In retrospect, each decade of Hollywood has had its trends, its levels of
                            adaptability, its innovations, and its turning points.

                                The 30s: the melodramatic decade
                            </b>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Talkies triumph, and Hollywood enjoys a golden age while European and Asian giants make new strides in film aesthetics. The pressures of the Depression make cheap, escapist diversion more popular than ever. Moviegoers in American cities have dozens of films to choose from, many shown in picture palaces of almost ludicrous splendour. The studios agree on a Production Code stipulating rules and regulations for movie content. Classics include Gone with the Wind, Godzilla, Stagecoach, The Wizard of Oz.
                            <br><br><b>The 40s: the noir decade</b>
                            <br>Film noir becomes a dominant style in Hollywood, telling dark, shadowy stories in a secretive, almost cynical style that suits the unsettled mood of Americans made anxious by war. Yet the musical, the comedy, and the melodrama also sustain their popularity, perhaps in hope of a better life. Classics include Citizen Kane, Treasure of the Sierra Madre, The Great Dictator, Casablanca, It’s a Wonderful Life, Double Indemnity.
                            <br><br><b>The 50s: the golden age</b>
                            <br>Ticket sales continue a decline that started after post-war, as Americans move to the suburbs and television becomes an increasingly strong competitor. Hollywood responds by experimenting with technical processes like 3-D and CinemaScope, trying to create experiences TV can't provide. Censorship loosens and the Production Code starts to crack. Classics include A streetcar named desire, To catch a thief, Vertigo, Rebel without a cause, Seven Samurai, Rear Window, Singing in the Rain, Cinderella, Sunset Boulevard.
                            <br>Before starting the 60s, there is an important question to rise: does the box office actually correspond to the decade’s history, or are we, based on the big classics, subconsciously linking it to the state of the country? That’s why, after some research, I found, for the 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s and 2000s, adjusted domestic box office totals of the top 50 movies from each decade, that prove statistically the intentions of the paying moviegoers
                            <br><br><b>The 60s: the spy decade</b>
                            <br><u>Family 26% Drama 25% Animation 20% Romance 12% Action 9% Western 8%</u>
                            <br><b>The public:</b> So what do we see? That 71% of the box office take for the biggest movies in the 60s belonged to the following genres: family, animation (also family driven), and drama. Where is the turbulence of the 60s? The social unrest? I guess they were too busy protesting to go to the movies. It is true that sex and violence are treated more graphically, and controversial subjects are explored with more candour than ever before in films, but it is surprising to realize that the public hasn’t yet caught up with the artists.
                            <br><b>The industry:</b> Young innovators like Richard Lester and John Cassavetes vie for positions alongside masters like Ford and Howard Hawks, who still sustain their careers in studios that are becoming more like financing companies than the image factories they used to be. Classics include The Good The Bad and The Ugly, Belle de Jour, Breakfast at Tiffany’s, West Side Story, Sound of Music, Psycho, How I learned to stop worrying and love the bomb.
                            <br><br><b>The 70s: the freedom decade</b>
                            <br><b>The public:</b> Wow! So maybe the societal changes of the late 60s didn’t fully invade mainstream film until the 70s. A total of 73% of the top box office money went to horror, sci-fi (famous for escapism), or crime films. And the only musical of the entire study, Grease, shows up amidst the darker fare. So between the 60s and 70s, there was a huge shift in what audiences wanted to see.
                            <br><b>The industry:</b> Named to be the greatest decade of filmmaking, the 70s brought some changes of its own. The runaway success of Peter Fonda's motorcycle picture "Easy Rider," with its low- budget and improvisatory style, spawns a flood of youth movies that generally seem more energetic than inspired; the 1976 hit "Rocky" gives the trend another boost. Hugely adventurous productions like Sam Peckinpah's violent "Straw Dogs" and Robert Altman's multi-layered "Nashville" give way to more conservative visions like Steven Spielberg's jolting "Jaws" and George Lucas's hugely popular "Star Wars" epic. Classics include Jaws, Alien, Star Wars, Apocalypse Now, The Godfather, Annie Hall, Chinatown, Close Encounters of The Third Kind, Monty Phyton and The Holy Grail, Rocky.
                            <br><br><b>The 80s: the blockbuster decade</b>
                            <br><u>Sci-Fi 42% Comedy 25% Action 24% Superhero 9%</u>
                            <br><b>The public:</b> The 1980s are probably known as the decade of blockbusters, particularly for generation x-ers. Did that hold up under the data? Amazingly, only four genres dominated the top 10 money-makers. Gone are family films, animation, drama, and romance. The voices of the Reagan decade wanted their movies big like their shoulder pads. The 25% comedy and 24% action values are impressive outliers, as no other decade had representatives in these genres to come close to those numbers. It looks like the decade of blockbusters earned its reputation. 
                            <br><br><b>The industry:</b> Independent filmmaking consolidates its position as a primary source of new ideas and vitality, with fresh talents ranging from Oliver Stone and Joel Coen to Jim Jarmusch and David Lynch. Americans show diminishing interest in subtitled films, but works by major directors like Ingmar Bergman and Bernardo Bertolucci make their way to commercial screens on a limited basis.

                            <br><br><b>The 90s: the undecided decade</b>
                            <br><u>Sci-Fi 28% Animation 21% Drama 12% Romance 12% Comedy 10% Suspense/Thriller 9% Action 7%</u>
                            <br><b>The public:</b> The 90s weren’t sure what they were for a while, and the movies reflect that. This was the most diverse decade that will ever be perhaps. Yes, sci-fi dominated again, and the advent of solid computer special effects opened the doors for what had been impossible or impractical. Animation also jumped back into the game, also thanks to computer animation (Pixar).
                            <br><br><b>The industry:</b> Women and African American filmmakers have a larger presence than in previous decades, as directors like Kathryn Bigelow and John Singleton carve out uneven yet sustained careers within Hollywood's power structure. Refreshed by an influx of younger members, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences becomes bolder in bestowing its coveted Oscars, honouring films like "The Silence of the Lambs" and "Unforgiven," which would have been considered too violent or undignified in bygone years. American pictures continue to win more than their share of prizes at the Cannes film festival, while at foreign films attendance stays scandalously low in US theatres. Classics include The Lion King, Dazed and Confused, Pulp Fiction, Toy Story, Boogie Nights, Home Alone, Titanic, Crash, The Fugitive, Romeo and Juliet, Goodfellas, The Shawshank Redemption, Pretty Woman, Men In Black
                            <br><br><b>The 2000s: the superhero decade</b>
                            <br><u>Sci-Fi 40% Superhero 30% Animation 11% Action 10% Drama 9%</u>
                            <br><b>The public:</b> People in the 2000s faced global terrorism and an unsteady economy. Sociologists would say that the populace wanted to escape from their worries. Did they? In a word, yes. Getting away from foreign wars and high gas prices was a priority. Sci-fi, superheroes, and animation accounted for 81% of the top 10 box office. All these genres rely heavily on special effects and computer animation. When you ask yourself why they are making drek like Green Lantern or Transformers, look at these numbers; the studios are.
                            <br><br>We can see that each decade had its own ‘film recipes’, with some reappearing genres and some disappearing ones (western, musical, mockumentary and war). These film recipes are simply meant to categorize and give clarity, structure to filmography, and offer the film director a jump-start: if the director reads a screenplay, he might interpret it in ten different ways, but only when he decides what it is: let’s say a horror investigative film, only then can he create a vision and propel the production. The raw screenplay represents nothing without that clear decision. Therefore, categorizing a film is very important for the production process, as it can help the artists steal and inspire themselves from great films from within that ‘film recipe’. I mean, why invent something that has already been invented? Of course, it might spoil some of the authenticity the audience is looking for, but well, you can’t make an omelette without breaking some eggs; and as the box office has been showing us all these decades, the audience isn’t necessarily looking for authenticity; by now you might have realized what it’s looking for: it’s looking to recognize these exact ‘film recipes’ in question.
                            <br><br>Now what did this study really tell us? It does corroborate the idea that in 1974, Jaws (the first real blockbuster), changed the film business. The types of genres being mega-successful before 1974 have not seen duplicate success. We also confirm that Star Wars kicked down the door for special effects, and that science fiction movies became the driving genre. Westerns, musicals, and sports movies may have a mild success story here and there, but they are not a factor at all anymore. I went into this research unsure of what to expect, but very interested in the results. What I am left with is a pattern pointing toward what I feared. Modern producers know what makes money, and they face a question. Do I back a movie because I love the art form/believe in this story, or do I back a movie because the odds are that it will make gobs of money? You, as a ticket buyer, are casting a vote with each purchase. You are ultimately left with the choice. What do you want to see more of?

                            <b>Hide, the critics are let loose!</b>
                            <br><br><i>“No critic writing about a film could say more than the film itself, although they do their best to make us think the opposite.”- Federico Fellini.</i>
                            <br><br>At last, we come back to the title of the article: professional criticism of film. But it was not all for nothing. We are indeed smarter men now: we have hopefully come to the consensus that there is an honourable quest of creating and finding a perfect movie, with perhaps a perfect mark; we know that the audience isn’t usually looking for, or paying for a perfect movie, as it subconsciously knows that it is a rare commodity; and we know that the ‘film recipes’, or cliches of the screen, are what we so perversely and shamefully desire.
                            <br><br>Yet…how do the critics give out those opinions so freely, and what do they take into consideration when judging a piece of art? Do they compare it to a ‘perfect movie’ and thus have high expectations? Do they pretend that it’s the first movie they have ever seen and give a most subjective and childish opinion? Do they order it within its film genre, ‘film recipe’, and value how well it has both respected stereotypes and innovated at the same time? Do they give it a particular score for every category: writing, acting, directing, editing, cinematography, sound mixing, special effects, set design and then calculate an average?
                            <br><br><i>“The nature of film criticism is to enlighten and enrich one’s experience with the art of film, not to interpret film for them”</i>
                            <br><br>By the 1920s, critics were analysing film for its merit and value, as more than just entertainment. The growing popularity of the medium caused major newspapers to start hiring film critics. In the 1930s, the film industry saw audiences grow increasingly silent as films were now accompanied by sound. However, in the late 1930s audiences became influenced by print news sources reporting on movies, and criticism became largely centred around audience reactions within the theatres.
                            <br><br>It was in the 1940s that new forms of criticism emerged. Essays analysing films with a distinctive charm and style sought to persuade the reader of the critic's argument. It was the emergence of these styles that brought film criticism to the mainstream, gaining the attention of many popular magazines; this made film reviews and critiques an eventual staple among most print media. As the decades passed, the fame for critics grew and gave rise to household names among the craft like James Agee, Andrew Sarris, Pauline Kael and, in modern times, Roger Ebert and Peter Travers.
                            <br><br>As we would all like to call ourselves critics, film criticism divides itself into two categories: journalistic criticism and academic criticism.
                            <br><br><u>Journalistic criticism</u> is what appears regularly in newspapers, magazines, and other popular mass-media outlets. A movie review documents the critical reception of a film at its time of theatrical or DVD release. It is more "consumer-oriented," placing more emphasis on recommendation than analysis.
                            <br><br>In the 2000s, the effect that reviews have on a film's box office performance and DVD rentals/sales have become a matter for debate. Some analysts argue that modern movie marketing, using pop culture convention appearances (e.g., Comicon) and social media along with traditional means of advertising, has led, in part, to a decline in the readership of many reviewers for newspapers and other print publications. There are fewer critics on television and radio in the last thirty years.
                            <br><br>However, in recent years, there has been a growing belief in the film industry that critic aggregators (especially Rotten Tomatoes) are increasing the collective influence of film critics. The underperformance of several films in 2017 was blamed on their low scores on Rotten Tomatoes. This has led to studies, such as one commissioned by 20th Century Fox, claiming that younger viewers give the website more credibility than the major studio marketing, which undercuts its effectiveness.
                            <br><br><i>“What the Internet has done is destroy film criticism. I would never have guessed that the profession of film criticism would be going the way of the dodo bird.”- Quentin Tarantino.</i>

                            <br><br><u>Academic criticism</u> is the way of the film scholars who are informed by film theory and are published in academic journals. More often known as film theory or film studies, academic critique explores cinema beyond journalistic film reviews. These film critics try to examine why film works, how it works aesthetically or politically, what it means, and what effects it has on people. Rather than write for mass-market publications their articles are usually published in scholarly journals and texts which tend to be affiliated with university presses; or sometimes in up-market magazines.
                            <br><br>Most academic criticism of film often follows a similar format. They usually include summaries of the plot of the film to either refresh the plot to the reader or reinforce an idea of repetition in the film's genre. After this, there tends to be discussions about the cultural context, major themes and repetitions, and details about the legacy of the film. Academic film criticism does tackle many aspects of filmmaking and production as well as distribution. These disciplines include camera work, digitalization, lighting, and sound. Narratives, dialogues, themes, and genres are among many other things that academic film critics take into consideration and evaluate when engaging in critique.
                            <br><br>Since emerging as a profession in the 1960s, film criticism has grown with the film industry while still retaining its essential function.
                            <br><br>Of all the arts – theatre, music, painting, literature etc. – perhaps no other is as universal or culturally shaping as cinema in the modern era. And as with every other art form, these are the experts who devote their time, careers, and expertise on critiquing films. These are those whose craft we search to understand- these are the professional critics that can dismantle your favourite film in seconds and leave you crying between the paragraphs. They probably have already!
                            <br><br>On a basic, simplistic level, films are a visual, interactive display of how we see our own world and give us insight into who we really are. They teach us, and warn us, and make us aware of things we have overlooked. They entertain us, and take us to new worlds, and places we could never have imagined. They shape who we are as a society, help us define what is right and what is wrong, and they inspire both positive and negative behaviour. In this way, film is truly a mass art.
                            <br><br>Can excellent acting work without a good director? Can beautiful cinematography be as effective without a talented editor? Of course not. Every little piece that makes the puzzle is taken into strong consideration by an academic film critic that is compiling a critical film analysis. Only the some of all these components can add up to a great film.
                            <br><br>Yet, to zero in on the ultimate criteria for a film’s greatness, it comes down to a combination of these things and more. Understanding why Citizen Kane, The Shawshank Redemption, Blade Runner and The Godfather continue to top the ‘best of’ lists each year, means there has to be something more to these films. Some kind of combination of aspects that go beyond merely one thing that makes them great. Some of the best movies of all time were box-office disasters. Still, they went on to have a life of their own, and after multiple viewings continue to be fan favourites. Are they just proof of our mass behaviour? Our nostalgic, hopeless trials of forcing art to withstand the test of time, just like people visiting The Endless Column pretend to be impressed by it?  A realist would answer ‘yes’ to such questions, but you see, well…I’d never listen to a realist. Realists make me cry- ugly cry. Me, instead, I just give no answer, and I choose to see my own meanings of art, because art is, frankly, the only reason to be alive.

                            <br><br>From time to time, I hear people saying that they’re tired of commercial movies, that they want to see at least one good, even great movie. So for those looking for a little bit of soul, I’ve tried my best to take a trip down memory lane and put together somewhat of a comprehensive archive, that is meant to not disappoint and perhaps stand as a reminder that:
