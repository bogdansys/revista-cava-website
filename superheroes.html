                        <h2>
                            Superheroes: from the beginnings
                        </h2>

                        <p>
                            “<b>There was an idea</b>: that we could bring together a group of remarkable people…to see if we could become something more. So when they needed us, we could fight the battles that they never could.”
                            <i>-Avengers: Endgame, 2019.</i>
                            <br><br>Man’s dream to fly came true a long time ago. The Wright brothers first touched the sky in 1903; just 66 years later, Apollo 11 touched the moon. And just like that, Adam was further away from the heaven he was expelled from, than he has ever been.
                            <br><br>So why did people want something more? Why did we need a man of steel? A wolverine? Seems foolish to think that a species that couldn’t manage Earth wars might have a shot at intergalactic ones. Yet, the man-in-cape has been an old attraction.
                            <br><br>Back in the day, they used to call comic books “funny pages”. So, long before the golden age of the superhero genre, the first screen versions of some of the most beloved characters to emerge from the "funny pages", started unspooling in movie houses nearly 80 years ago. Of course, those early incarnations of DC and Marvel comics looked very different from the new ones, as studios regarded them as cheap Saturday matinee quickies meant for kids. I think they’d have a funny look on their face seeing the annual billions made on today’s “quickies”.

                        <p>
                            The first superhero movie was arguably a 12-part serial and French production called Judex, made in 1916 by filmmaker Louis Feuillade. In 1939, the American superhero that premiered onscreen was Mandrake the Magician, as 12 chapters. Warren Hull starred as the title character and battled the Wasp, an evil masked scientist trying to steal an energy machine. The Shadow followed in 1940, in which a former World War I aviator uses a variety of alter egos to fight crime.
                            <br><br>But the first true superhero movie — the kind we are familiar with today — arrived in 1941 with the 12-chapter Adventures of Captain Marvel. It guided and shaped the genre, influencing all the dark knights, caped crusaders and galactic guardians that were to come, giving them four basic elements that cemented into place the successful superhero blockbuster: an origin story, a secret identity, a costume and an arch-nemesis.
                            <br><br>The legendary vigilante and his sidekick, Robin, made their first appearance in 1943, in the 15-chapter Batman. According to Bruce Scivally's book Billion Dollar Batman, the serial took liberties with the comics: instead of the Batmobile, the dynamic duo tooled around in a Cadillac driven by faithful butler Alfred. It was inevitable that the former Krypton resident who started the men-in-tights craze would turn up at the movies too, and sure enough, Superman got his own multi-chapter saga in 1948, starring Kirk Alyn.
                            <br><br>But by the late 40’s, the entire notion of tune-in-next-week shorts in theaters were quickly becoming outdated; the last of the superhero serials, Batman and Robin (1949) and Atom Man vs. Superman (1950) closed out the decade.
                            <br><br>Superheroes did not re-emerge in theaters until 1978, with Superman: The Movie. Produced at a staggering cost of $55 million, the Richard Donner-directed film was an epic in every way, from its star-studded cast (led by Marlon Brando as Jor-El, and Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor) to its then-pioneering visual effects and its galaxy-spanning scope. At the center of it all was unknown actor Christopher Reeve, whose work as both the earnest Clark Kent and the majestic Superman has never been bettered.
                            <br><br>Superman was received enthusiastically by both critics and audiences, earning a­ massive $300 million at the box office. It was followed in 1981 by Superman II, which Donner had begun filming at the same time as the first movie. The Superman series began to fade at the box office throughout the rest of the 1980s.
                            <br><br>Bruce Wayne was ready to take up the slack after nearly a decade of development hell. Directed by Tim Burton, who was at the time a no-name, a freshman in the industry that he would later dominate, and starring Michael Keaton in the title role and the established Jack Nicholson as the Joker, Batman was the blockbuster movie of 1989, earning more than $411 million at the box office. Dispensing with the camp tone of the 1960s series, the movie adopted the darker, more psychologically twisted approach of comics like The Dark Knight Returns. For the younger generations, a dark, misunderstood and complex Batman is the only way a batman could be, yet this vision was fabricated by Tim Burton, and kept through the years that were to come.
                            <br><br>The 90’s brought us the independent movie Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles(1990), a surprising hit! Also, subversive anti-hero protagonists, as shown in The Mask(1994) and The Crow(1994), widened the horizons of the genre, proving that there is room for play, and that the audience is open to more than the industry standard.

                                Marvel- The rising sun
                            </b>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The son of Austrian-born Jews, Jack Kurtzberg was an all-American brawler. It wasn't a profession, and it wasn't a hobby. In New York City's Lower East Side of the early 20th century, where Jack grew up, it was a way of life. In 1990, Jack recalled for The Comics Journal: "You know, the punches were real, and the anger was real; and we'd chase each other up and down fire escapes, over rooftops, and we'd climb across clotheslines, and there were real injuries."
                            <br><br>While the Lower East Side taught Jack to fight, Jack taught himself to draw. In his early 20s, having assumed the name Jack Kirby ("I wanted to be an American," he would say), Jack and fellow artist Joe Simon sold Timely Comics on a character which, informed by certain Lower East Side tendencies, would fight and fight and fight. Let Superman fly the bad guys to jail, and let Batman stalk his prey with his wits -- Kirby and Simon's Captain America would handle Adolf Hitler with a sock to the jaw. 
                            <br><br>Even if Jack’s Captain America needed some decades to come to life, the Marvel dream was formed, and the studio, rising from its disgraceful ashes, saw the light once again in the late 90’s, with the promise of a full rebirth in the early 2000’s.
                            <br><br>In 1997, Columbia Pictures released the enormously popular Men in Black, starring Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones. It was based on a title published by Malibu Comics, which had been purchased three years earlier by Marvel Comics — indirectly making Men in Black Marvel's first hit at the box office. A year later, New Line Cinema released Blade, the first successful movie based directly on a Marvel character. Headlining Wesley Snipes as a human/vampire hybrid who hunts other bloodsuckers, Blade was an unexpected hit — and paved the way for Marvel to finally get a toehold with movie audiences.
                            <br><br>Blade arguably opened the door, but 20th Century Fox kicked it down in 2000 with the long-awaited X-Men. Based on one of Marvel's oldest and most popular titles, X-Men had been in development for more than 15 years before director Bryan Singer finally shepherded it to the screen with Patrick Stewart as Professor X, Ian McKellen as Magneto and a then-unknown and future Hollywood stud Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. The $75 million production earned $296 million worldwide, confirming that superheroes not named Superman or Batman could succeed on a large-scale level with audiences.
                            <br><br>At the same time, longstanding legal issues surrounding the rights to Marvel's biggest character, Spider-Man, were finally resolved, clearing the way for the webslinger to swing onto the big screen. Directed by Sam Raimi and starring Tobey Maguire, Spider-Man earned a record-busting $407 million in the U.S. alone.
                            <br><br>Blade II (2002), X2: X-Men United (2003) and Spider-Man 2 (2004) followed in quick succession, almost all improving on their predecessors both in quality, and box office. Other Marvel-based movies, such as Hulk (2003), Daredevil (2003), Fantastic Four (2005) and Ghost Rider (2007), had more mixed responses with audiences and critics. But the Marvel movie brand itself was here to stay.
                            <br><br>By 2006, Marvel Studios had bolstered its character stable with the buyback of movie rights to Thor and Hulk, and announced its first directing hires, including Jon Favreau for Iron Man. The same year, the movie studio made its panel debut at the pop-culture proving ground that is San Diego Comic-Con. There, Feige was asked if Marvel might be open to character crossovers. 
                            <br><br>"You listen to the characters I've named, that we're working on currently, and you put them all together, and there's no coincidence that that may someday equal the Avengers," Feige replied. 
                            <br><br>The line drew applause, but the typically low-key executive didn't seem as if he wanted to make a splash. He was simply stating comic-book fact — something that would be understood by those immersed in the Marvel universe. As they came short on budget, short on production rights and short on character rights, creating the MCU(a big Marvel Cinematic Universe from small characters) was the only getaway that Marvel had.
                            <br><br>2008's Iron Man, starring Robert Downey Jr. was for the ex-convict and junkie Robert Downey Jr. a career-reviving role as industrialist-turned-superhero Tony Stark. Directed by Jon Favreau, the fast-paced, witty movie, launched the Marvel Cinematic Universe aka MCU: a visionary, unparalleled series of interlocked films in which characters cross freely into each other's stories and team up every few movies to defeat a cosmos-threatening menace — the screen equivalent to the comics that fans had enjoyed for decades.
                            <br><br>Even if the producers had hoped for a breakthrough, Iron Man was, in a way, so much more than expected. It wasn’t only a breakthrough- no, it was the golden ticket to the chocolate factory. The world wide audience embraced Marvel, pat them on the back and maybe even whispered: Welcome back. We’ve been waiting *wink*.
                            <br><br>IN the meantime, DC has been carried by Nolan’s directing genius, Christian Bale’s dedication and Heath Ledger’s legacy in Batman Begins(2005), The Dark Knight(2008), The Dark Knight Rises(2012)- movies that admit their independent spirits, showing little to no resemblance to the previous DC projects. Man of Steel(2013) and the fame of Henry Cavill made a spark that started a fire: Justice League(2017) and Wonder Woman(2017), the former being a critical and box-office success. Suicide Squad(2016), Deadpool(2016),  Aquaman(2018) and Joker(2019)are also DC enterprises with more or less venture. It is easily seen, that this age of superheroes shapes itself differently.

                            If the sunrise brought the golden age of superheroes, now the setting sun brings no promise. The next day might just be like the day before, for it seems that superheroes are here to stay for a while. Superheroes were meant to be leaders, patriots, symbols of national identity in an age divided by world wars. Yet in this new world, the man that flies is no longer a hope, a symbol- he is too common to be one anymore. Popular culture and adolescent curiosity have absorbed him- he is now diverse, social, ironic, cultured. Still, his lack of stoicism and his found humanity are not weaknesses: he is not losing himself, he is simply transforming into something else. He is no longer unique, distinct, he could be each one of us. That is the motto of this generation’s man-in-cape: that anyone can be him, that anyone can be a superhero. And perhaps touching the moon was never enough for mankind; who is there to tell the limit of our imagination?
