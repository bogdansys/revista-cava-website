                                The wind of change is once again sweeping through Russian cities, threatening to open Kremlin’s gates and unveil its corruption scandals. This time, the wind has a name and it is Alexei Navalny. Having recently survived and recovered from assassination
                                attempts after being hospitalized in Germany, he has now returned home, where he was welcomed both by his supporters and by the police. After the opposition leader was detained, on January 23rd, people took the streets
                                to protest the lawlessness imbedded in the architecture of their government.

                                Alexei Navalny is an opposition leader, one of the most vociferous critics of the Russian government. He rose to prominence in 2008 thanks to his blog, when he started writing about alleged malpractice at some of Russia's big state-controlled corporations.
                                He later created his Anti-Corruption foundation in 2011 and a YouTube channel, which has more than 6 million subscribers. He is constantly investigating the corruption that is hidden behind Russia’s oligarchic system, where
                                power is held in the hands of a few, at the expense of the rest of the population. Due to the corrupt power structures in Moscow, the economy is suffering and many people are affected. Navalny aims to prove these irregularities.
                                Though he is very courageous in the face of a regime that tries to murder him, that doesn’t mean he is entirely liberal. He is extremely nationalistic and holds far-right views on immigration, similar to Trump’s, but the
                                problem is that he is not criticised for them.

                            How did this all begin?

                                In August 2020, Navalny was poisoned and lost conscience in a flight over Siberia. He was hospitalized in Berlin. German officials say Navalny was poisoned with a Novichok nerve agent, a Soviet-era chemical weapon. He accuses Putin of trying to murder
                                him and releases a recording of him tricking an FSB (Federal Security forces) agent via a phone call into confessing that he tried to kill him by putting poison in his underpants. The FSB denounces the recording of the
                                phone call as fake. “Stay abroad or rot in jail” is the choice Vladimir Putin offered to Alexei Navalny. When he returned to Russia, on January 23rd, he was detained and put on trial in a police station. The charge was
                                violating parole, while lying in a German hospital, he had been unable to check into a police station in Russia. He was found guilty and sentenced to 30 days’ imprisonment. He awaits a second trial scheduled for February
                                2nd that could see him locked up for three and a half years and possibly much longer. It is worth mentioning that case for which he violated parole had been overturned by the European Court of Human Rights, to which Russia
                                belongs, though Russia had refused to accept the court’s authority in this matter.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                A quote the activist has managed to record from the courtroom: “I don’t understand what is happening. A minute ago I was led from a cell for a meeting with my lawyer. I came here and was told that a court proceeding is taking place here…. I’ve seen a
                                lot of mockery of justice, but this time [Vladimir Putin, the Russian president] in his bunker is so afraid of everything that he has demonstrably torn into pieces Russia’s criminal code and thrown it into a dump.” Could
                                Putin indeed be afraid of Navalny? He is indeed questioning the things Putin tries to protect the most: his strongman persona and his ability to influence people into believing he is doing what’s best for the Russian population.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                When the activist was in prison, his team has released a film about Vladimir Putin’s finances and a secret palace alleged to have been built at the cost of Russian taxpayers. The video was viewed over 100 million times. This represents a massive hit for
                                the president, who is allegedly stealing from the population and whose support might consequently decrease. The Kremlin denies that the palace belongs to Putin, trying to maintain his political support which is based on
                                lies.

                            How did the protests start?

                                Navalny has called his supporters onto the streets on January 23rd. “Don't be afraid. Take to the streets! Take to the streets not for my sake, but for your own sake and [for the sake of] your future!” he said. The people listened to him and took the
                                streets to protest the lawlessness they are witnessing every day in their country. The numbers are unclear: police figures show 4000 people, though there are much more than this number. The highest estimates are at 40.000,
                                Navalny’s people say there are definitely not less than 25.000 protesters. The dynamism and courage are spreading through the population as fast as the wind and snow are in a Siberian winter. We are witnessing people protesting
                                in extreme conditions in places like Iakutsk where the temperature goes lower than -50 degrees, which shows how much dedication they have. What could be said about these protests is that they are quite different from the
                                ones in 2011 because they didn’t obtain authorisation from the government. The people didn’t bother to do that, because they knew the government wouldn’t allow it. Navalny is characterised as a traitor by the government
                                and his allies are co-conspirators. Hopefully, these protests will last more than the ones in 2011, which started with hundreds of thousands of people, but weeks after the number decreased to only thousands of people. Cornering
                                the state, demanding something from it never yields anything in Russia, or at least it didn’t yet. If you accuse someone of corruption, you get more corruption. People are never fired because of corruption. In the worst-case
                                scenario, they are moved into another department. The state has the ability to cover and to find excuses for everything through the national propaganda machinery, as we have seen in the recent allegations thrown at Moscow.
                                Only 15% percent of the population believes that Putin poisoned Navalny, which not a small percentage, but it is not enough to end corruption.

                                Hoping to end this article in a more positive way, I will say that there might be light at the end of the tunnel for Russia, but there is still a long way until there. In the meantime, victories like the ones from this month, when we witnessed unprecedented
                                demonstrations where people stopped being afraid and started being hopeful, are to be celebrated.
