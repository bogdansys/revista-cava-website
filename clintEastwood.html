                        <h2>
                            "How Clint Eastwood directs masterpieces"
                        </h2>

                        <p>
                            Many have known him as the face of western, and if he were to end his career there, he’d be called a legend. But with his rich contribution behind the cameras, he turned into even more. <br><br>
                            From <i>Sudden Impact (1983)</i> to <i>Million Dollar Baby (2004)</i>, it’s safe to say that, as a director, he left his well-earned mark in American cinema. <br><br>
                            Having been nothing less but a visionary for decades, Clint Eastwood became a master of the drama genre. His greatest work came during his old age, and perhaps that’s a lesson to be learnt: that the human mind is strong enough to carry the body. Still, time remains forever our enemy, and Eastwood’s age is rounding at a rare 90. That’s why, his working days in the industry are counted, and they certainly come as a blessing. <br>
                            Truth is, as much as I love movies, and I do love movies a whole lot, I understand the apathy regarding old movies- I really do. We grew up with the Internet, with HD and then 4K, with Dolby Atmos sound technology, and Avengers-level CGI. Of course we want to see clarity on the big screen, and pixels in the thousands. These are the standards of the digital world. It’s strange and difficult to look at movies of the 70’s and 80’s and see them as innovative in any way. It’s a sort of <i>you had to be there</i>. I think cinephiles don’t admit that outdated styles and techniques of filmmaking actually interfere with the audience’s ability to understand and experience the storytelling. How can you ask a young person nowadays to watch <i>Men in Black, Alien, Terminator, 2001: A Space Odyssey,</i> George Lucas’ <i>Star Wars</i>, and expect them to be impressed? And they had poor baby Drew Barrymore running in circles around that pile of mud in <i>E.T.</i>!<br><br>
                            So I’ll only take two movies directed by clint Eastwood, made in this millennium, to discuss. <br><br>
                            1. <i>Changeling (2008)</i><br><br>
                            <b>Summary</b>: It is the factual account of a mother whose little boy disappeared, and of a corrupt Los Angeles Police Department running wild. Angelina Jolie stars as Christine Collins, whose 9-year-old son, Walter, went missing in March 1928.<br><br>
                            Many things happen on a production: hundreds of both technical and creative people, working together, organizing, planning to the minute. And still… when we see the finished product, we only see the obvious: the protagonist.<br><br>
                            And there she stands, looking as fragile as a sparrow, with hunched shoulders and trembling lips, eyes looking through under the eyelids, putting on some of the best work of her life-long career. Acting is probably the most emotional, heart-felt, <i>human</i> job in the whole world, and the director can either make an actor or break him. It stands out that Eastwood has learned the art of creating a safe environment, a safe set, for Angelina Jolie to step into her most vulnerable state, and live a deep pain of abandonment and misunderstanding. She loses what is most precious to her, and yet her love for her child only grows stronger, very much in the way lionesses are said to fight for their pups. The director works with the actress towards finding that truth and resilience inside of her, and unleashing them in front of the camera. As the action advances, Angelina finds herself not only alone in her fight towards finding her kidnapped child, but standing against the local police department and the decade’s specific accusations of insanity and hysteria. Undeniably, this story follows more than just a mother, but a <i>woman</i>, in her struggles with a harsh system and different times, that refuse to acknowledge her or listen to her. It stands as a re-appraisal of the depiction of women in the early 20th century, seen as ‘second-class’ citizens. More movingly, Jolie’s task is to show each calibration of her maddening loss, as she is caught between suspended grief, fear, isolation, and anger. Her emotions, although completely natural, are regarded in the 1920’s as something else entirely, and her bare womanhood becomes an obstacle towards finding her son. <br><br>
                            Perhaps, this is a reflective quote:<br><br>
                            Carol Dexter to Christine: <i>“Everybody knows women are fragile. I mean, they're all emotions, no logic, there's nothing going on upstairs. Every once in a while, they say something that's a little inconvenient, they just go fucking nuts. Pardon my French. If we're insane, nobody has to listen to us.”</i><br><br>
                            The film asks some personal questions: what would one do in such a situation? How far would you go for your own flesh and blood? Would maintaining a rational behavior come easy to you, or would it be completely out of the question? The film leaves you feeling uncertain, wondering just how strong we really are, when faced with some bad odds, and how hard we can love before we should learn to let go.<br><br>
                            In this movie, as in most of his movies, Eastwood provides a rare type of raw, unfiltered emotion, and he leads it in a captivating, escalating fashion. His work feels real: very real, very human. Through his choice of adapting a real-life story, he benefits from strong material, that of repressive systems and intolerable situations, which the audience feels the need to emphasize with deeply. Clint Eastwood’ famous, recognizable signature style is displayed in the police investigative procedural. Changeling displays directness. It has not a single unnecessary stylistic flourish. No contrived dramatics. No shocking stunts. A score by Eastwood, that doesn't underline, but observes. The film simply tells its relentless story and rubs the LAPD's face in it. It mounts a sober and credible critique of the corrupt LAPD. <br><br>
                            Cold tones, the blue and dark brown colors, are often used in the movie’s cinematography, to keep a serious and reflective air. Outside of the mother-child narrative, this is the story of an administration that directed from the top down, to lie, cheat, torture, extract false confessions, and serve to protect its image. It reminds of <i>L.A. Confidential (1997)</i> and <i>Spotlight (2015).</i><br><br>

                        </div><br>
                        And then comes the design. Movies are the most visual medium of entertainment you could find, and the framework needs to be the best set up lie; it just needs to sell, and in <i>Changeling</i>, it does. Clint Eastwood chooses industry-renowned Deborah Hopper (<i>Jersey Bous, J. Edgar</i>) for the costumes, and they add just enough glamour to the Los Angeles scene. <br><br>
                        In one interview, Angelina acknowledged their importance: <i>“There is something about the style of the clothes of the ‘20s, that is very sweet. They make you feel a little softer, and just so delicate, hidden behind it all. It helped me very much.”</i><br><br>
                        <div class="feature-img">

                        </div><br>
                        Being a period-reconstruction drama, it’s safe to assume that a big chunk of the budget went to recreating a little 1920’s world, and Eastwood, being meticulous, really managed to deliver with it. Maybe the suburban homes looked a bit too contemporary, but everything else was right to a tee. <br><br>
                        Back then, at the beginning of women’s involvement in the workforce, ladies were only switchboard operators, typists, or secretaries. I loved how Christine and the other switch boarders would run around the telephone exchange in rolling skates- I found that just adorable, such a hidden jam of the past, that I’d have never known otherwise. Overall, it’s admirable that the realization of the lost world of 1928 LA, never allows its expected color to obscure or upstage the human drama.<br><br>
                        Other meaningful quotes<br><br>
                        <i>“Once you give people the freedom to do whatever they want, as the Lord found in the Garden of Eden, they will do exactly that.”<br><br>
                            “The more you try to act sane, the crazier you start to look. If you smile too much, you are delusional or you are stifling hysteria. If you don't smile you are depressed. If you remain neutral you are emotionally withdrawn, potentially catatonic.”</i><br><br>
                        Conclusion<br><br>
                        It’s a tough movie, but also rewarding and inspiring: something of a quiet triumph.<br><br>
                        2. <i>Million Dollar Baby (2004)</i><br><br>
                        <b>Summary</b>: Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) is a veteran Los Angeles boxing trainer who keeps almost everyone at arm's length, except his old friend and associate Eddie "Scrap Iron" Dupris (Morgan Freeman). When Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) arrives in Frankie's gym seeking his expertise, he is reluctant to train the young woman, a transplant from working-class Missouri. Eventually, he relents, and the two form a close bond that will irrevocably change them both.<br><br>
                        <i>Million Dollar Baby</i> breaks your heart. It just does. And if it doesn’t, maybe you don’t have a heart.<br><br>
                        <div class="feature-img">
                            <img class="img-fluid" src="mace6.jpg" alt="">
                        </div>
                        <br>
                        It’s been said that Miss Hilary Swank gave the <i>performance of a lifetime.</i> And damn right she did- she won her Best Actress Oscar for it. Movies are so often made of effects and sensations. This one is made of people, and how their actions grow out of who they are. Flawless. Breath-taking. With real moral weight. The movie doesn’t actually have much to do with boxing, but it hits as hard as a knockout punch.<br><br>
                        Aging boxing cut-man and manager Frankie Dunn is one of the best trainers in the business. He owns the crumbling Hit Pit gym in L.A. and runs it with the help of his longtime friend and former boxer Eddie “Scrap Iron” Dupris. When Maggie, an eager female boxer in her 30s starts coming to the gym, the gruff Frankie refuses to help her: <i>I don’t train girlies.</i> But with her persistence and Eddie’s persuasion, Frankie gives in. As she moves up the ranks, she and Frankie grow closer. But a freak accident drastically changes both their lives, and leaves Frank questioning his faith in God and the limits of his relationship with Maggie.<br><br>
                        It's bittersweet, juggling both extremes with rare skill. The ending has that you love it, but you hate it style. Its washed-out noir look makes it stand out visually. It contains almost too much emotional power, too much depth. <br><br>
                        These three characters are seen with a clarity and truth that is rare, and difficult to portray. Eastwood, who doesn't carry a spare ounce on his lean body, doesn't have any padding in his movie, either: even as the film approaches the deep emotion of its final scenes, he doesn't go for easy sentiment, but regards these people, level-eyed, as they <i>do what they have to do.</i><br><br>
                        Some directors lose focus as they grow older. Others gain it, learning how to tell a story that contains everything it needs and absolutely nothing else. "Million Dollar Baby" was Eastwood's 25th film as a director, and his best. <i>Mystic River (2003)</i> and <i>Unforgiven (1992)</i> are great movies, but this one finds the simplicity and directness of classical storytelling; it is the kind of movie where you sit very quietly in the theatre, and are drawn deeply into lives that you suddenly happen to care very much about.<br><br>
                        There's this scene, at night driving in a car, after Frankie and Maggie have visited Maggie's family. The visit didn't go well. Maggie's mother is an ignorant and selfish monster. "I got nobody but you, Frankie," Maggie says. She tells Frankie a story involving her father, whom she loved, and an old dog she loved, too.<br><br>
                        The way Eastwood uses the light in this scene has a powerful role in conveying the characters’ feelings. Instead of using the usual "dashboard lights" that mysteriously seem to illuminate the whole front seat, he has their faces slide in and out of shadow; sometimes we can't see them at all, only hear them. Watch how the rhythm of this lighting matches the tone and pacing of the words, as if the visuals are caressing the conversation.<br><br>
                        It is a dark picture overall: a lot of shadows, many night scenes, characters who seem to recede into private fates. It is a “boxing movie” in the sense that it follows Maggie's career and has several fight scenes. She wins from the beginning, but that's not the point; <i>Million Dollar Baby</i> is about a woman determined to make something of herself, and a man who doesn't want to do anything for this woman… but in the end, will do everything. For her, Frankie becomes the father she had always wanted. For him, Maggie is the daughter he could have never raised. <br><br>
                        <b>Conclusion</b><br><br>
                        The movie is straightforward and clear, almost concise, even with a 2h and 12min run. In many ways, it feels known, old, conventional. Still, it promises to leave you with an empty stomach, asking yourself if you’ve got what it takes. Knowing that you can do anything you want, anything you dream… but it all depends on you. How far would you go to make it come true? Would you give it your all? Would you give it your best?<br><br>
                        How hard would you fight through that cold, dirty mud?<br><br>
                        <i>“People die every day, mopping floors, washing dishes and you know what their last thought is? I never got my shot.”</i><br><br>
                        <b>Other meaningful quotes</b> <br><br>
                        <i>“It’s the magic of risking everything for a dream that nobody sees but you.”<br><br>
                            “Instead of running from the pain like a sane person would do, you step into it.”<br><br>
                            “Anybody can lose one fight, anybody can lose once.”<br><br>
                            “I've seen the world. People chanted my name. You think I ever dreamed that'd happen? Daddy used to tell me I'd fight my way into this world, and I'd fight my way out. That's all I wanna do. I got what I needed. I got it all.”<br><br>
                            “She's not asking for God's help. She's asking for mine.”</i> <br><br>
                        Clint Eastwood movies have been categorized as grown-up movies. His work is somewhat brutal, yet he never used violence for it. He didn’t need to impress the audience, or make a statement… he shows the brutality of life, as it is. And it’s brutal enough, alright.<br><br>
                        You can feel a sort of resignation of one’s self, the plain idea that “This is what life is. It is what it is. People fall, people hurt; things happen. And I’ll try my best, but at the end of the day, life just happens.“ It really teaches you to accept the world, and the way things work, consequences of actions or lack of action, and the harsh reality. And it encourages you to live for yourself, and make your own choices, because everyone else is living for themselves. Don’t wait for a grant, or the perfect circumstances. Do what you can, with what you have, right now, for you.<br><br>
