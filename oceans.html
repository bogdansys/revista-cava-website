                                Ocean’s charisma - “Ocean’s Eleven”
                            </h2>

                            <p>
                                Robbing the biggest casinos in the world never looked so good and never felt so easy. Cause Danny Ocean and Rusty Ryan stink of class, confidence, and making things work. Tonight, the house does not win.
                            </p>

                            <div class="feature-img">
                                <img class="img-fluid" src="oceans1.jpeg" alt="">
                            </div>

                            <p>
                                Named for years one the most rewatchable crime comedies, with leads like the bachelor of 2000’s Hollywood- George Clooney; the pre-Angelina Brad Pitt; and a pretty woman (no pun intended) - Julia Roberts, the first of the Ocean’s Series has a charisma
                                of its own.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                I might be fascinated by the director’s framing, but what any audience member can feel is an easiness and self-assurance in the charismatic aura that the main characters possess. It’s the easy way out to think that all good-looking people are attractive
                                just because they are, well, good-looking, but that’s not the whole truth.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Truth comes that, in order to be attractive to the public, Danny Ocean and Rusty Ryan are written as very realistic, under the radar, magnetic and a pleasure to be around kind of men. I strongly admire the way they carry themselves, how they lead without
                                intimidating and the calm and clarity that they offer to any situation. They are as confident as they are peaceful, and they find solutions as quick as they create the problems. You leave the cinema with a good taste in
                                your mouth and reassurance that confident people truly make things go in their favour easier than anyone else.
                            </p>

                                What is exactly the psychology behind their persona, gestures, and written lines?

                            <p>
                                I find serenity in the basics, that is why I will name some fundamental starting points as behavioural characteristics of the alluring protagonists, with some in-depth details.

                                Practicing long, elongated hand gestures shows that you are comfortable enough to take your time even in uptight or stressed scenarios. A straight back and relaxed shoulders work their way into a strong and silent type of attitude that is observed and
                                desired in the film. Such physical attributes make it easier for you to actually become relaxed and comfortable in your own skin and decisions. This not only offers a steady and reliable state of mind, but also self-confidence.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                A most wanted consequence is that people start seeing you as trustworthy, because you seem to trust yourself and your own instincts. What you think and what you stand for will always be projected into your interactions. If you project a peaceful state
                                of mind, then that is what people will observe and what they will respond to. We know that people mirror each other: we mirror emotions, attitudes, gestures, sometimes entire lifestyles. Even if, let’s say, social interactions
                                are the least of your concerns, take into consideration that a peaceful state of mind still provides you with clarity and rationality. Where the overreacting and exaggerating are missing, the freedom, time and energy come
                                to replace them.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                We see the benefits of Danny Ocean’s tranquillity and self-confidence from another perspective as well: if Danny, the thief of the casinos would be considered the prey, and Terry Benedict, the guy who owns the casinos, would be the predator, then the
                                prey’s smooth conduct is very misleading. Danny knows he’s guilty, he knows the predator’s coming for him, but he doesn’t worry, and he doesn’t care. Why? Because he knows that if he doesn’t act like a prey, he won’t be
                                seen as one. There you have it- the old mind trick of “fake it till you make it”- that is more than valid in real life. You choose what you want to portray yourself as, and that is what the majority of people will see.
                                As a generalisation in the case of Danny Ocean, he practices being self-composed, undisturbed, collected. He makes a habit out of it and he slowly becomes the embodiment of “no worries”. Well, that would be the “behind
                                the scenes” to the process of shaping his attitude and tolerance to situations. Of course, in the film, we get to see only the chiselled, finished product- otherwise, nothing would be as impressive.

                                The master plan of robbing the casinos is thought and led by Ocean and Ryan, but it needs other 10 people to be put into motion. It is easy to observe that within a team not led well, more people are equal to less than one in efficiency and productivity
                                matters. The individual abilities seem to be lost if not protected and used wisely by the leader. What Ocean does, that is most effective, is explain not only how the plan displays itself and what the steps are, but most
                                importantly, why each step is necessary to the entire scheme.

                                As an analogy, statistics show that the greatest numbers of dead soldiers on the battlefield have appeared under the command of generals that only gave the orders, but never explained the reasoning behind them. Even within such a strict and hierarchical
                                institution as the army, every individual maintains their free will and own judgement. That is why regimes of absolutist monarchies never satisfied most of the population- because the folks never got a chance at understanding
                                the system or the orders. At a small scale, each team represents a country that is led by the team leader.

                                Ocean offers his team the chance to understand the plan fundamentally. But that is not all that he does- he insists on receiving the feedback, because he knows the importance of it. A leader must content the members and answer their needs, at least in
                                the first stages of their collaboration.

                                Constantly asking for permission, even at not so desperate times, not only deepens uselessly your own insecurities and low self-esteem, but it acknowledges them to everyone around you. There is beauty in stating instead of asking; there is relief in affirming
                                instead of wondering. First of all, you live for yourself, no one else. Therefore, your needs and desires, if there is anyone that should take them into consideration- that would be you. I would like to add, that trying
                                to impress those around us (family, friends, lovers, mentors) is a hopeless, deplorable habit, that mostly brings disappointment. It is simply impossible to make everyone happy-but you must try with yourself.

                            <p>
                                But there is a firm line between pure arrogance and self-respect, and we can find it in the way we verbally express our needs and desires. Without making this more complicated than it needs to be, we can use the screenwriter’s trick- “if it’s alright”;
                                ”would you”; ”you understand that”. These are polite syntagms that pleasantly manipulate the other person into thinking that they have agreed to the situation, they have reciprocated and that they have been in control.
                                Keeping these appearances leads us to the next bullet point:

                            <p>
                                We get comfortable with those around us, it is inevitable. Yet all people, whether we’ve known them for a week or a lifetime, they all want to be appreciated, admired or at least recognized for their actions, and especially efforts. Don’t let their endeavours
                                go away unnoticed, but don’t make a big deal out of nothing either, cause that will feel ironic and forced. Danny Ocean uses several easy, polite and quick one-liners:

                            <p>

                                A side character says in a serious manner: "The only problem is that I have to pay you by check", to which Ryan Rusty just stops and waits, making eye contact profoundly, closing his eyes a little bit in a sign of irritation. Seconds later, the side character
                                corrects himself, saying that he can actually get the cash.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Rusty doesn’t need to speak in the situation, because he knows that his demeanour speaks for himself. He does not need to make threats, because the way he carries himself is already threating enough. His presence feels like the calm before the storm,
                                and the prolonged eye contact is a technique used to show a glimpse of the possible storm.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                As for the world of cinema, eye contact is a very important tool. This type of stare down, eventually with a subtle smile, has been long used to portray a silent confrontation between the men(it is only used for men, generally speaking) that identify
                                as enemies on some levels. We see it so often we’re almost getting tired of it, but it truly seems to find its place even in the modern action movie close-ups (“Fast and Furious” franchise, MCU franchise, “John Wick” franchise,
                                “Mission Impossible” franchise). Now an issue that rises is that, when directed or framed poorly, the scene makes the audience feel funny, doesn’t it? Such a situation had happened in 2006’s “Casino Royale”, a movie which
                                brought the James Bond “genre” back on its feet. A scene of intense eye staring between Bond and his torturer gave the media a huge scandal, with half the Internet questioning the actual intentions of the scene. The film
                                had enjoyed a box office of 616.5 million dollars, so its impact was spread and powerful.

                                Well, more exactly, the look, from the audience's perspective can almost come off as sexual, and to be frank, it is from an evolutionary point of view- any confrontation comes from the need of marking your own territory.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Nowadays it might mean winning a promotion against your co-workers. But back in the day, physical action was required, and many times through history, more than admitted, forced homosexual activity, as in taking maximum control of the receiving individual,
                                was used in this Machiavellian manner, being interpreted as winning the confrontation. Not rare it is that male facial expressions that depict superiority and self-assurance have been found to correspond with those of male
                                participants that were about to conduct in sexual activity with a male or female. The same concept can also be found rooted in the boxing tradition.

                                Eye contact is a powerful mean, and as described already, it can be used with various connotations. For wining discussions or favours you would be surprised to see that it can work better than a logical argument or a pretty promise.

                                6. The “getting things done” mindset
                            </h2>

                            <p>
                                Some call it work ethic, others discipline, but I don’t think it is either.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Ocean’s and Rusty’s plan naturally falls apart many times. The team makes mistakes; messes up; exterior, unexpected factors intervene; Ocean’s ex wife comes out of nowhere. And yet, in such extreme, unusual conditions, there’s not a thought of doubt that
                                they won’t make it somehow. They have the goal, and they are profoundly certain that somehow, they will reach it. They can fall in love with problems, because they are in love with solutions. The word pessimism does not
                                exist in their vocabulary.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                They lead a suspicious at first and uncertain team into the safe ground of their healthy mentalities. At some point, in their upbringing, they have written their own vision: making things work, getting things done. They are willing to fight endlessly
                                and do anything to get what they want and they need. They have the courage to prioritize themselves over anyone else, acknowledging that they need to feel good in order to make anyone else feel good.
                            </p>

                            <h2>
                                Conclusion:
                            </h2>

                            <p>
                                Compared to other film personas that might come off as impressive indeed, George Clooney and Brad Pitt's roles offer a realistic, intelligent, quiet, self-sufficient and beneficial for all the parties involved kind of charismatic behaviour. The self-intitled
                                "genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist" mindset of mainstream Marvel legend, Tony Stark, is only admirable for the audience, but it is not advised to be replicated in real life scenarios.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                In real life, we should seek to make a positive impact, rather than just make an impact.
