                        <h2>
                            The girl outside the train
                        </h2>

                        <p>
                            The first time I saw her was the day after New Year’s Day. I think it was really early in the morning ‘cause there weren’t many people on the street. The cars were loud, though. You could hear them from blocks away. I was on my way to see an old friend, but my car had got snowed in the night before and I couldn’t use it, so, in a way, I guess you could say it was fate that brought us together. But, to be completely honest, I couldn’t give less of a damn about this whole destiny shit. If we’re just variables in some powerful Greek God-thing-equation, then what’s the point? No, really – what’s the point? How do we know if we’re doing something worth the place we’re taking up? I’ve known so many people all my life, yet I can’t seem to be able to make a difference between them. They all blend together. And she. She blended in the most. That’s probably how I even noticed her. She was sitting on one of those scrappy old benches along the back end of the platform. She had short hair. Yeah, she did. She did have short hair. And I know I wasn’t expecting it. I thought she’d have long hair. Or at least long-er hair. By then, the blizzard had turned into an outright storm so her hair was basically wet. That was another thing I noticed. She could somehow stay warm enough to melt down the tangled snowflakes from her hair. It wasn’t anything special, but she looked so peaceful. Sometimes you need to see what peace looks like to remind yourself that life’s still worth living. Even if only for a stranger you spotted once on the platform.
                           <br> Her rubber knee-high boots looked cheap, but she must’ve been well off because she didn’t seem to feel cold. That’s how you can tell someone’s got money. They never feel cold when they’re supposed to. It made me wonder if she’d ever felt cold.

                            <br>It was hard to see, but I'm pretty sure her lips were cracked. Really cracked. And she was biting them unconsciously, too. How many of those cracks had been made and how many of them had been found? It's almost impossible to tell. So I didn't. And I don't. I usually try not to assume anything. But then again, assuming is what we do, so I guess so much for that.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            There was this one thing, though. It felt really intimate. It wasn't, of course. But in my mind it will live like it was. She was reading a newspaper. Or, actually, upon a closer look, she was solving a crossword. Now, for these things, you usually use a pencil or a pen or a sharpie or whatever you use to write stuff with. And I know this because I solve crossword puzzles every morning. It's nice. It calms me down. It's a nice way to start the day. But she wasn't writing anything down. It was as if she was solving them in her head. She probably was. I think she was. She was staring that piece of paper down, like it knew something she didn’t want let out into the world. Maybe it did, I don't know. The point is that for a fraction of a second - for a tiny splinter of time - she brushed her eyes over my window. It was the only interaction we had and I don't know whether it was for the better or not.
                        </p>


                        <p>
                            Something flew out of her bag. She bent down to take hold of it, but it flew away even farther. She didn’t struggle at all to catch it, though. It pained me to see her composure not falter for even a second. She straightened up and went on as if nothing had happened. She had a pair of black sunglasses and a pair of leather gloves that she was fiddling with; she kept putting them down and picking them back up. She didn't look frightened or anxious - she looked like a hurricane on the brink of becoming a light gust of wind. And nothing betrayed a thing she was thinking. She knew what she was, she knew where she was and why she was there and she held herself to a set of standards I couldn’t possibly begin to guess. I would've asked her if she was in control, but the train whistled and set off too soon.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The last glimpse of her I caught was a golden hoop earring dangling down to her shoulder. It was nice. I couldn’t stop thinking how nice it was. And it was just that. Nice. A nice piece of jewellery on a nice girl with nice rubber boots and nice short hair. And off I was.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The doors creaked when they opened; it was so cold that I could almost see small icicles breaking as the doors slided open. I wraped my scarf tighter around my neck and stepped off the train. It was more pleasant than I had expected, weirdly enough. Not too pleasant, though. It really was cold.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I rang his door and someone I didn't know answered. There were lots of people. And I mean lots. It kinda fazed me, I'll admit to this. I wasn’t angry about it, I just hadn't expected it. I didn't start feeling scared until I went up. It was probably the longest staircase I'd ever climbed. The steps just wouldn't stop. I don't know if I even wanted them to. It felt weird. I didn't want to feel weird. I didn't like it. So I closed my eyes. I closed them shut. Really hard. When I opened them, she was standing at the very top. I didn't think I'd miss her so much. I didn't want to have to miss her so much. She eventually went away and I went on. And there it was, and there I was. God, that door.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I was still afraid. I don't think you can be less afraid of something you've been afraid of all your life. Life's like that sometimes. But I did walk through the door. And I did say "Hi" to the people there. And I opened the casket.
                        </p>
