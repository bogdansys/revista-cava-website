                            When I Grow Up- A Story About Beds
                        </h2>

                        <p>
                            It got really cold after 3 am in his room. Regardless of the heating system - for which his parents paid a great deal of money, regardless of the blue and white blanket he found hidden in a stocking 2 years before. It always gets cold after 3. That's about the time when you start noticing things. Things like how the burgundy velvet curtains kind of don't feel as expensive as they used to ( and you're suddenly too tall to hide behind them ). Like the way your bedpost creaks or how the floor is slippery. You notice the voices, too. Strange - you never used to. He never used to either. Were they always there? He won't know it for a long time but yes, they were. 3 is also a foggy period of time. You can't quite make out what is true and what isn't. The things you see are almost never what they truly are and the things you don't see are almost always what you fear they are. But he got through 3 and then slept until somewhere around 7.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            It was at 7 that he started to see. He opened his eyes - not because he wanted to, but because he had to. You often have to at this time. It's only natural. If you didn’t, people would start asking questions. And not the nice kind of questions, but the ones that make parents question their parenting even when there should be no questioning on their part. At 7 he changed his comfy bed for the cold, white wooden kitchen chair. It was the kind of chair you found in an Ikea catalogue kitchen. Neat, clean, “spick and span”, as his mother always said. It was a nice chair; he couldn’t deny that. He wasn’t the kind to deny the obvious. But something felt off. He sensed it in the air, in the way his dad was putting away the already washed dishes, in the burnt bacon on his plate. There was a heavy silence hanging around his parents and an even heavier feeling of unease started creeping inside him. The hell that unleashed afterwards rendered him silent. His father’s fist landed hard on the table and the cutlery clanged just as hard. The sound was unbearable, but he bore it all.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            At 9 he was ready to go out the door and leave for school. Just before, though, there was a pause, almost unnoticeable. Then his mother cleared her throat. Her smile had been getting shabbier for the past hours, but it was only now that he realized it. How could he not have seen it? What followed was a quick unfolding of terrible events. They were redecorating his bedroom. “You’re getting too big for that old bed of yours, you know? We thought we’d change it up a bit.”, said his mother. Before he knew it, his father had the car keys in his hand and his parents had already decided that he agreed to the changes. He hadn’t said anything, but then again, there was little difference he could have made.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            School started at 14:00, as usual. He just didn’t feel like going through the motions he usually went through at school. It’s a weird feeling. Not feeling at peace with yourself and with your habits. It’s destabilizing. He felt it then, stronger than ever. And, somehow, his friends knew it. They were feeling it, too. Somehow…the school was just too small for any one of them to fit in. So, they decided they wouldn’t. the world is so big, why should they be kept prisoners? Unbeknownst to their teachers and their parents, they ditched school for the day. It was exhilarating. And terrifying. And completely bonkers. It was their first time ditching school. For some, it would also be the last. It wouldn’t be the last for him. They didn’t go far because distance didn’t make them free. They went over to the park. They didn’t know it then, but that park was going to be the centre of an almost infinite web of possible futures. So many new beginnings started from that one, small beginning. So many that he would eventually lose count and forget altogether about the first day he ditched school. That’s what happens. It happens to each and every one of us. Forgetting. Remembering. They made a promise to return there once every season. They thought it `cool`. He would find out sooner enough that no promises remain unbroken. He would also find out that he didn’t mind it that much.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Meanwhile, he would find a girl. No, let me rephrase that. He would find the girl and he would love her. He would love so hard. He already loved her so much that at 16:00, after running out of things to do in the park, he invited her over to his house. He was mesmerized and so sure of himself. Until she looked back at him and smiled. The smile she gave him was enough to make him question everything he thought he knew. It was scary – the power she’d begun to have over him in seconds. He was ready to burn a world down. And build another one just for her. That’s what he was about to do when he stumbled across the top left blue cabinet in his parents’ bathroom. It was his mother’s. He was looking for some sanitizer. He was looking for some sanitizer. He was looking for some sanitizer when he found her stash of cigarettes. He’d never seen his mother smoke before. If he was honest, he hadn’t seen his mother do much of anything for a while. The box was crumpled up. It was as if someone had used it as an anti-stress ball. There were 3 cigarettes left inside. His fingers prickled when he picked one of them up, but he went on the way he’d seen people do in the movies. Ironically enough, he’d grabbed the box of matches before going up to the bathroom. It’s small things like this that make life a mystery waiting to be unfolded. It’s the mystery of how a gut feeling turns up to be the best or the worst decision ever. His mouth was dry and there was a slight tremor to his right hand. When he was done, he put the box back in the cabinet. Not once did he think about offering her a cigarette, too. Not once did he think about throwing them out.

                        <p>
                            The clock was ticking away and, suddenly, it was time for her to go home. They hugged, she laughed, so oblivious, so aware, and then left. It was over as soon as it began, and he wasn’t sad; he was tired. 18:00. The house was getting bigger by the second, but he couldn’t tell why. He took the leftover pizza from the fridge, microwaved it, sat down at the dinner table. He ran his fingers across the back of the chair. The white paint was coming off. Looking around, he couldn’t really recognize the house. The walls seemed to be caving in just as the roof seemed to be getting taller and taller. He tried calling his friends, but, of course, they were all home. Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick. He could hear his alarm clock. Very clearly. Clocks are tricky fellas, you see. You never know what they do or how they do it. You just know that, in the end, it's they who decide when you wake up and when you go to bed. And as much as you try, as many beds you change - you don't outrun or outsmart or outbest them. So, you won't enjoy the early hours of the day or the very late ones. Because then you'll be too busy trying and failing to run away from them. It's the in-between hours that count.

                            has to go to bed in ways you couldn't even imagine. And whatever comes after 18? Well, he can worry about it later. For now, it's just tick, tick, tick, tick, tick...
