                        <h2>
                            Art performance: Marina Abramović
                        </h2>

                        <p>
                            Marina Abramović is a Serbian conceptual and performance artist, as well as a writer and filmmaker. She is rightfully considered a founder of what we know today as “art performance” having a life-long dedicated career and spreading her work and passion worldwide. Despite being a big celebrity of the art world, this is probably the first time some of you hear about her. Marina’s work is seen as a revolutionary and unique way of performing, some calling her fearless, genius, raw and even crazy. Truth be told, her performances are everything but ordinary. In order for anyone to better understand the messages she is portraying to the public, you should know a bit of her background.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            She was born on the 30th of November 1946 in Yugoslavia (now Serbia) Belgrade, a communist country at the time. Her parents were war heroes who fought against the Nazis, later becoming important members of the political party. From this point of view, one could say she had a privileged life, in the sense that her passion for art was always financially supported through supplies and books. However, her mother never bought her the clothes she wanted as a child, she actually never bought her anything else that wasn’t related to her education. Danica, her mother, was a strict and cold person, who didn’t show her any affection and understanding. She was so fixed upon doing things her way, that Marina was forced for a good part of her life to have a 10 pm curfew, even when she was 25 and married. She experienced a lot of physical abuse too, as her mother would beat her up all the time, even without a particular reason. Her childhood was filled with loud fights between her parents, who never showed any love for each other. In fact, they would each sleep with a gun on their night stand. Marina would also experience intense migraines, just like her mother. The pain would incapacitate her for an entire day. This was actually the beginning of her incredible relationship with pain and her high tolerance towards it. Why is pain so important when talking about Marina Abramović? Because all of her art performances imply forms of physical pain. She herself said in her book titled ,,Walk Through Walls” that a mild plane turbulence will send her shaking, but when it comes to her work “the pain must shut up”. For her art is like life and death. Nothing else exists…nothing as necessary and serious.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            However, Marina wasn’t always an art performer. She initially started painting and her work was incredible. Later on she felt the need to do and express more. That was when she realized her body could push those limits of conceptualism. She started getting the attention of the public with her daring first pieces. The most popular today bears the name of Rhythm 0. It took place in 1974 in Napoli. Marina was to sit motionless on a chair behind a table for six hours. On the table were 72 objects, amongst which: a hammer, a saw, a feather, a fork, a perfume bottle, an axe, a rose, scissors, a bell, needles, a newspaper, lipstick, sugar, a Polaroid camera, honey, a lamb bone, a knife and many other objects, including a gun and some bullets. The people who arrived at the Morra Studio were left some instructions on the table. They were allowed to do anything to her for the next six hours and she would take full responsibility. In the beginning not a lot happened, however, little by little things started getting interesting. The women would usually tell the men what to do, instead of doing it themselves, but it was a woman who wiped Marina’s tears when someone stabbed her with a pin. One person cut her shirt with the scissors and another poured a glass of water on her head. A woman wrote END on her forehead with the lipstick. A man took the knife and made a cut on her neck then drank her blood. The highlight of the night was when someone loaded the gun and pointed it at Marina’s head. He was escorted out of the gallery by some others. Soon after that, the six hours were over and the performance had ended. The next day, tens of people called the Studio apologizing and claiming that they didn’t know what went wrong with them. So you might ask yourself what was the purpose of the art performance. Marina explains it herself. She wanted to demonstrate the lengths at which people will go and the things they will do, when they are not legally responsible. A utopia where there are no laws and any action is permitted. To this day, Marina still has the scar on her neck.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            She continued to do many other pieces. Some of those titles are Rhythm 10, Rhythm 2, Rhythm 4, Incision. In all of her solo performances, blood, danger or nudity were present. The latter was the main reason for which her mother was not pleased with Marina’s work. Being a public figure, she considered that her daughter had embarrassed her, which is why she took a glass ashtray and threw it at Marina’s head saying “I gave you life, now I will take it from you”. She managed to avoid the fatal blow.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Marina Abramović is an artist who dedicated her life to her work. She pushed all the humanly limits one could imagine in order to portray the most authentic message to the public. She explains that once a performance began, she would go through a portal which transformed pain and fear into something else. Her legacy is incredible and her work can barely be described in words. One of her biggest performances done with her life partner at the time was each of them starting from the opposite end of The Wall of China and meeting in the middle. Her dedication to this difficult task was incredible, even if, at the time she did the performance, she had already separated from her partner. However, the purpose of this journey was much more important to her. Her work is so complex, that only the mind of the artist herself can truly explain everything, which is why she wrote her book, which answers the question: Who is Marina Abramović, really?
