                            <h2>
                                The rise of AOC - "A much needed change in Congress"
                            </h2>
                            <p>
                                Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, better known by her initials AOC, is an American member of the U.S House of Representatives for New York’s 14th congressional district since 2019 and part of the Democratic Party. At the age of only 31, she is known to be the
                                youngest woman ever to serve in the United States Congress, having taken office at age 29, which has propelled her into the eyes of the younger generations. Another factor that has put the young Democrat in the spotlight
                                is her unquestionable implication in the current global issues and her remarkable speeches, where she does not hold back on speaking her mind.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                From having an asteroid named after her in high school for important research in the biological field to graduating from Boston University cum laude, Ocasio-Cortez has been working her way up ever since. Hired as a bartender and waitress, while also launching
                                Brook Avenue Press and organizing Bernie Sanders’s (American politician, U.S. Senator from Vermont) presidential campaign, she started showing interest not only in politics but also in helping and supporting her community.
                                After her Campaign in April 2017, when she was still waiting tables, she challenged Joe Crowley, the Democratic Caucus Chair, being the first person to do so since 2004. On June 26 2018 Ocasio-Cortez wins by almost 15 percentage
                                points. The defeat of Rep. Crowley was the one that brought her nationwide attention.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Ever since then, she has attacked many difficult topics and made drastic changes for her community. She approached the issue of immigration with immediate action for the refugees at the border. The American Dream and Promise Act of 2019, which would financially
                                help the immigrants, showed her implication in the issue. The U.S Democrat has also put a lot of accent on healthcare and the service provided to those with less financial possibilities. That is why she is an unapologetic
                                advocate of Medicare for All, wanting to create a system in which every single person in America would have access to high-quality and consistent healthcare. She is also currently associated with Congressional Oversight
                                and Government Reform Committee, facilitating the appearance of a generic version of PrEP, an HIV prevention drug by a year.

                            <p>
                                What sets young Rep.Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez apart from her fellow House members is the connection with her community and the interest she takes in matching as many generations as possible. In a committee of oversight and reform hearing, she spoke about
                                the fact that the government has tried to undermine LGBTQ+ rights. She accuses lawmakers of “weaponizing and abusing scripture to justify bigotry” by using their Christian faith to marginalize communities such as LGBTQ+
                                people. She continues by stating “There is nothing holy about turning someone away from a hospital”, pointing out the white supremacy, racism, and homophobia, which is still present and tolerated in today’s society. “I
                                am tired of it” AOC states, following her exposing of the corruption.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So far, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has not only been present in the public eye, during hearing, but also online. She has a considerable media influence, using Twitter and Instagram as her main platforms of communication. What has gained her a rapid following
                                is the content she puts out on the media. Her Instagram stories are not only insiders into the Capitol in D.C, but also what the life of a U.S Representative looks like. Her videos do not portray a glamourized view of politics,
                                but rather a raw image of the life in Congress as a young woman. She is set out to educate her community regarding their rights and laws, with constant detailed Q&A’s.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                AOC has also acquired quite a lot of recognition from her remarkable tweets. One of her most significant fights which took place not only on Twitter, but also in a House Floor Speech is the famous ‘AOC vs. Rep.Yoho’. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was verbally
                                assaulted by fellow member Ted Yoho, as she was walking the stairs of the Capitol. He called her “crazy”, “disgusting”, “dangerous “for speaking on impunity. Later that day he proceeded to call her in front of the reporters
                                “a f------b----“. The Congresswoman took this chance to address a serious issue of today’s society: abuse towards women. She pointed out the disrespect he has brought on the opposite sex. AOC continued to talk about the
                                dehumanizing language in “a pattern of an attitude towards women and the dehumanization of others”. Following the manner of Yoho’s apology, Ocasio-Cortez says “to see the excuses and to see our Congress accept it as legitimate
                                (…) I could not allow that to stand”, which is why she proceeds to call him out in the speech. “Treating people with dignity and respect makes a decent man” are the words she uses to expose the superior behavior of some
                                men in Congress. As a conclusion to the incident, AOC does not only expose the misogyny and immaturity of her fellow members but also calls out real issues within the Congress.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As her achievements have shown, AOC is a determined feminist and evaluate of equality, fighting for her community and the well-being of the nation. She has inspired younger women to stand up for themselves and believe in their own strength. A strong advocate
                                of the phrase “Femininity has power”, and constantly fighting for recognition in a domain, generally ruled by men, is what makes her a role model. The way in which she stands for her beliefs and takes action to prove her
                                strength is what caught my attention, making me want to know more about her work. The term “self-made” is more than appropriate when it comes to describing AOC. Starting from the ground up, by waiting tables and trying
                                to help her mom financially, after the passing of her father, she build her career on her own work. Earning her famous #aoc2024 on Twitter is one of the main aspects which show the incredible response to her actions. Alexandria
                                Ocasio-Cortez has never been afraid to pick a fight with anyone, no matter their status or power. Considering her achievements, many view her as a true model, including myself.
